<p>I fell in love with skiing about three years ago when I first gave it a try. I still consider myself a newbie, I have only used Green and Blue slopes, but I hope to be able to go down a Diamond slope one day. My ultimate goal would be to ride alongside my ski mates on a Double Diamond slope. I guess we'll see about that. Why I love this sport one might ask. For many reasons, but just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it is really peaceful and meditative;</li>
	<li>you constantly have to look for a balance, more like a harmony between your skis, the snow and the sopes;</li>
	<li>it offers access to truly amazing scenery; floating through the landscape is an incrdible feeling;</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you are wondering what the colors I mentioned before represent. They indicate the difficulty level of the slopes. The table below will help you understand them. </p>
<table border="2">
<tr>
	<th>Color</th>
	<th>Difficulty</th>
	<th>Symbol</th>
	<th>Slope gradient</th>

<tr>
    <td>Green</td>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td style="color: green"><b>&#9899;</b></td>
    <td> 25% or less </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Blue</td>
    <td>Intermediate</td>
    <td style="color: blue"><b>&#9744;</b></td>
    <td> 25% - 40% </td>

	<td>Difficult</td>
	<td style="color: black"><b>&#9830;</b></td>
	<td> 40% or more</td>

<td>Expert</td>
<td><b>&#9830; &#9830;</b></td>
<td> 40% or more with obstacles</td>

<p>Although skiing is an awesome activity, it can also be dangerous. If you want to test it out, make sure you sign up for a class first so you are shown a few basic moves and postures. And remember to always wear a helmet. Even this penguin here knows that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.skiingmag.com/">This website</a> aproaches the same topic. I have studied the page source and I recognized the basic html elements. Other than observing it is a well structured, complex website, there is not much I can comment on being good or bad. I guess I will be able to do that latter on.</p>
