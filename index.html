<h1>Skiing - one of my favorite hobbies</h1>
<p>I fell in love with skiing about three years ago when I first gave it a try. I still consider myself a newbie, I have only used Green and Blue slopes, but I hope to be able to go down a Diamond slope one day. My ultimate goal would be to ride alongside my ski mates on a Double Diamond slope. I guess we'll see about that. Why I love this sport one might ask. For many reasons, but just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it is really peaceful and meditative;</li>
	<li>you constantly have to look for a balance, more like a harmony between your skis, the snow and the sopes;</li>
	<li>it offers access to truly amazing scenery; floating through the landscape is an incrdible feeling;</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you are wondering what the colors I mentioned before represent. They indicate the difficulty level of the slopes. The table below will help you understand them. </p>
